# Infotainment-System-Project
This repository contains my Infotainment System project, developed as part of the Embedded Linux Scholarship offered by AMIT and Orange Digital Center (ODC). The project showcases my journey through this scholarship, which provided comprehensive training in Embedded Linux systems, from kernel development to device drivers and file systems.
